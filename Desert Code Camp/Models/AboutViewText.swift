            "\n" +
            "By and For the Developer Community\n" +
            "Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Free\n" +
            "Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Community Developed Material\n" +
            "The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "No Fluff: Only Code\n" +
            "Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Community Ownership\n" +
            "The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Never occur during work hours\n" +
            "We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.\n" +

I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI. I am a public speaker and present internationally on a lot of different technology topics, a list of them are available at https://www.josephguadagno.net/presentations/.  I have been recognized as a Microsoft MVP in .NET (since 2009) and a Friends of Red Gate program(since 2015).\n"
